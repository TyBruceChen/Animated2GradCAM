# Animated2GradCAM:   Grad CAM Visualized & Interactive
This repository is devoted to making image classification results Grad-CAM-visualized and interactive.

This is the COVID-19 diagnosing visualization in Vision Transformer by our research: [A Vision Transformer Machine Learning Model for COVID-19 Dagnosis Using Chest X-Ray Images](https://github.com/TyBruceChen/Research-A-Fined-Tuned-ViT-for-COVID-19-Image-Auxiliary-Diagnosing/tree/main).

Specifically, I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Toby Hocking, who has introduced the powerful [animint2](animint2) R package to me.
